                    <strong><em>Lucifer</em></strong>  is the story of the original fallen angel.
                    Bored and unhappy as the Lord of Hell, Lucifer Morningstar has 
                    resigned his throne and retired to the City of Angels, where 
                    he owns an upscale piano bar called Lux. Lucifer is enjoying
                    his retirement and indulging in a few of his favorite things—wine,
                    women, song—when a beautiful pop star is brutally murdered outside of Lux.

                    <br>For the first time in roughly 10 billion years, he feels
                    something awaken deep within him. He's not sure whether it's 
                    his suppressed desire to punish the wicked or something deeper
                    and more confusing—is he actually capable of feelings for a human 
                    being? The very thought disturbs him—as well as his best f
                    riend and confidante, Mazikeen (aka Maze), a fierce demon in 
                    the form of beautiful young woman.

                    <br>The murder attracts the attention of LAPD homicide detective 
                    Chloe Dancer, who finds herself both repulsed and fascinated 
                    by Lucifer. As they work together to solve the pop star's murder,
                    Lucifer is struck by Chloe's inherent goodness. Used to dealing 
                    with the absolute worst of humanity, he begins to wonder if there's hope yet.

                    <br>At the same time, God's emissary, the angel Amenadiel,
                    has been sent to Los Angeles to convince Lucifer to return to Hell.
                    But with the City of Angels at his feet and a newfound purpose,
                    Lucifer's having too much fun to go back now.
                    
                    <br>Sexy, dark and irreverent, this one-hour drama from Jerry Bruckheimer 
                    Television, based on the characters created by Neil Gaiman, 
                    Sam Kieth and Mike Dringenberg for DC Entertainment's Vertigo imprint, 
                    offers up the concept that everyone might have a chance 
                    at redemption... even the Devil.
